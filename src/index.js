// First we need to call on these components 
import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; 
// Importing the actual apps
import App from './App'; 

// This is basically saying that I would like to render all the things with the root. 
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
